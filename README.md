# UNet Image Segmentation Model
This repository contains an implementation of a UNet model for binary image segmentation using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is applied to a synthetic dataset created from a single image, where a simple thresholding technique generates a binary mask. The UNet model is trained to segment this mask.

#About the Project 
 This project demonstrates a basic UNet architecture for image segmentation. The UNet model is a common choice for biomedical image segmentation tasks due to its encoder-decoder structure, allowing it to learn both spatial and contextual information. Here, the model is trained on a single synthetic dataset to predict binary masks from input images.
