# UNet Image Segmentation Model
This repository contains an implementation of a UNet model for binary image segmentation using TensorFlow and Keras. The model is applied to a synthetic dataset created from a single image, where a simple thresholding technique generates a binary mask. The UNet model is trained to segment this mask.
